# scriptsSSH-escuela
These are the scripts I use to manage a computer lab in a school.

Although they were created for the specific case of a particular school,
maybe it can be useful for someone else.

Take into consideration that the **computers in the lab have fixed ips**:
- 192.168.10.1 (The teacher's computer)
- 192.168.10.2 (A student's computer)
- 192.168.10.3 (Another student's computer)
- ... etc, etc ...
- 192.168.10.27 (The last student's computer)

The scripts use zenity as UI. Messages are in Spanish.
